# Hey there 👋 I'm Susan

I’m a data engineer with a builder’s mindset: less about buzzwords, more about making things that work and turning half-baked business ideas into working systems.

## 🔧 What I’ve Built

### 🧪 Veritas
**A table comparison and validation tool for real-world data pipelines.**
- Catches mismatches between your tables and source-of-truth reports
- Flags issues, logs them cleanly, and exports diffs to CSV
- Designed with actual stakeholder headaches in mind
- Currently adding test coverage + considering the possibility of an api
  
> I first built this as a scrappy proof-of-concept during my internship (`Veritas_POC`—yes, the one-file wonder). Now it's a real tool!

### ☕ Starbucks: More than an Overpriced Cup of Misspelt Coffee?
**A data storytelling project on coffee habits.**
- Compares Malaysian vs. Western customer behavior through visual storytelling
- Found the dataset, understood limitation, cleaned it, analyzed patterns, and visualized them to tell a fun but pointed story
- No, the baristas didn’t sponsor this. Yes, I still drink overpriced coffee.

## 🧠 What I’m Into

- Designing people-centric solutions, anything to make the experience more personal & relevant
- Designing **resilient data systems**
- Scaling pipelines without crying
- Automating boring stuff so humans don’t have to

I’m currently upskilling in systems design and data-intensive application architecture. I’ve read about cool infra, now I'm looking to build it.

## 🤝 Let’s Talk

I’m open to roles where I get to **work with cool people, own problems, build solutions, and grow fast**. Especially if there's mentorship, collaboration, and room to contribute meaningfully.
